          2021(Oct- Present) - Lead Facilitator, Dev Academy, Christchurch
        </h2>
        <p>
          After completing the intensive 15 week web development bootcamp
          offered by Dev Academy, I was hired by them to join their online
          bootcamp facilitator team, where my key role was to help facilitate
          students’ learnings. This involved answering any questions that
          students may have and helping them find a way to solve problems. Later
          on, as I was promoted to lead facilitator in 2022, my responsibilities
          also giving lectures, running several projects as a product owner &
          team lead, managing a team of facilitators and leading the online
          bootcamp experience.

          2016 – 2020 - ESL Teacher, EF Language School, Auckland
        </h2>
        <p>
          Taught English as a second language to students aged 16+ from various
          countries. (Pre-Intermediate to Advanced levels). Teaching a class of
          17 students for 6 hours everyday really helped me develop my public
          speaking & management skills and improve on active listening as well.
          This role also involved planning and organising teaching material
          which requires creative and critical thinking. The most important
          skill that I feel I learnt on the job was social perceptiveness where
          you have to become aware of other’s reactions and understand why they
          react the way they do.
