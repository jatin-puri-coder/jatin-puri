          2021(Oct- Present) - Lead Facilitator, Dev Academy, Christchurch
        </h2>
        <p>
          I started as a facilitator in the online bootcamp team, where my key
          role was to help facilitate students’ learnings. This involved
          answering any questions that students may have and guiding them to
          find a way to debug their problems. Later on, as I was promoted to
          lead facilitator in 2022, my responsibilities also included giving
          lectures, running several projects as a product owner & team lead,
          managing a team of facilitators and leading the online bootcamp
          experience.

          2016 – 2020 - ESL Teacher, EF Language School, Auckland
        </h2>
        <p>
          Taught English as a second language to students aged 16+ from various
          countries. (Pre-Intermediate to Advanced levels). Teaching a class of
          17 students for 6 hours everyday really helped me develop my public
          speaking & management skills and improve on active listening as well.
          This role also involved planning and organising teaching material
          which requires creative and critical thinking. The most important
          skill that I feel I learnt on the job was social perceptiveness where
          you have to become aware of other’s reactions and understand why they
          react the way they do.
